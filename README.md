## Writing

I am a writer with twenty years of experience, with recent work as a copywriter and technical writer. I am actively seeking full-time employment. Please get in touch: [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/alvin-charity). 

## Programming

I am a self-taught JavaScript/TypeScript/Python programmer currently making markup and domain-specific languages, writing tools, and various little quality-of-life programs. Additionally I have extensive experience in the shell with Bash and Zsh. My previous professional programming experience includes business workflow automation, web programming, and creating developer tooling. I will use any opportunity I can to learn a new language -- I have previously dabbled with Lua, TCL, J, and F#, and I'm currently learning more about Ruby and Go.
