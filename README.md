## About

I am a writer, musician, technologist, and self-taught `JavaScript`/`TypeScript`/`Python` programmer currently tinkering with [markup languages](https://github.com/unforswearing/todo_markup.js), [documentation tools](https://github.com/unforswearing/xdoc), [writing systems](https://github.com/unforswearing/poyml), and various [little programs](https://github.com/unforswearing?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=shell) to improve my quality of life at the terminal. My previous professional programming experience includes business workflow automation, web programming, and creating developer tooling. I will use any opportunity I can to learn a new language -- I have previously dabbled with `Lua`, `TCL`, `J`, and `F#`, and I'm currently learning more about `Ruby` and `Go`.

All code is in the public domain unless otherwise specified.

## Seeking Employment

In addition to my writing and programming experience, I am a capable workflow designer, content manager, and information specialist, and have four years of experience working as a certified Project Management Professional. Looking for roles that will allow me to learn new tools and systems while flexing my creative and technical knowledge. Please get in touch if you would like to hear more about my professional experience and goals.
