## About

I am a writer, musician, technologist, and self-taught `JavaScript`/`TypeScript`/`Python` programmer currently tinkering with [markup languages](https://github.com/unforswearing/todo_markup.js), [documentation tools](https://github.com/unforswearing/xdoc), [writing systems](https://github.com/unforswearing/poyml), and various [little programs](https://github.com/unforswearing?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=shell) to improve my quality of life at the terminal. My previous professional programming experience includes project management, business workflow automation (primarily using [Google Apps Script](https://github.com/unforswearing?tab=repositories&q=gas)), web programming, data analysis, and content creation. I will use any opportunity I can to learn a new language -- I have previously dabbled with `Lua`, `TCL`, `J`, and `F#`, and I'm currently learning more about `Ruby` and `Go`.
