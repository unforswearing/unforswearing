## About

I am a writer, musician, technologist, and self-taught `JavaScript`/`TypeScript`/`Python`/`Ruby` programmer working at the intersection of communication and code.

Currently tinkering with [markup languages](https://github.com/unforswearing/todo_markup.js), [documentation tools](https://github.com/unforswearing/xdoc), [writing systems](https://github.com/unforswearing/poyml), and various [little programs](https://github.com/unforswearing?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=shell) to improve my quality of life at the terminal. All code is in the public domain unless otherwise specified.

## Hire Me!

I am currently seeking employment in any position that will allow me to blend my communication and technical skills. My previous work includes copywriting, technical writing, project management, business workflow automation (primarily using [Google Apps Script](https://github.com/unforswearing?tab=repositories&q=gas)[^*]), content management and administration, and data analysis. Please visit my portfolio for writing samples, or check out my LinkedIn profile to view my professional experience.
