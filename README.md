I am a technical writer, copywriter, and occasional programmer. My time is mostly spent making markup and domain-specific languages, writing tools, and various little automations.

Need help writing technical blog posts, onboarding guides, or documentation for your project? Please get in touch: [unforswearing.com](https://unforswearing.com).
