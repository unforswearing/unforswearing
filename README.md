I am a technical writer, copywriter, and occasional programmer, currently making markup and domain-specific languages, writing tools, and various little quality-of-life automations and scripts.

Need help writing technical blog posts, onboarding guides, or documentation for your project? Please get in touch: [unforswearing.com](https://unforswearing.com).
