I am a technical writer, copywriter, and occasional programmer. My time is mostly spent making markup and domain-specific languages, writing tools, and various little automations.

Note: I am open to short term, project based writing work. Portfolio: [unforswearing.com](https://unforswearing.com/#portfolio).
