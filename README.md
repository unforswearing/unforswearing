> Hi, I'm Alvin. I am open to part time or full time work, remote or local to the Baltimore-Washington DC corridor. I am especially interested in business process automation, Google workplace scripting, and fullstack development, but I am open to all offers. You may find examples of my work in this Github profile, or over at [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/unforswearing).

> I look forward to hearing how I can help you!
