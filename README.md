> Hi, I'm Alvin. I am a self-taught developer open to part time or full time work, remote or local to the Baltimore-Washington DC corridor. I am especially interested in web development, tooling, and automation, and I'm open to learning just about anything. You may find examples of my work in this Github profile, [Github Gists](https://gist.github.com/unforswearing), or over at [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/unforswearing).
>
> In the meantime I have been doing a bit of consulting work. Please feel free to get in touch if you would like to chat about Google Apps scripting, or general web development.
>
> I look forward to hearing how I can help you!
