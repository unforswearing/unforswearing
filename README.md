> Hi, I'm Alvin. I am a developer open to part time or full time work, remote or local to the Baltimore-Washington DC corridor. I am especially interested in business process automation, Google workplace scripting, and fullstack development, and I'm open to learning just about anything. You may find examples of my work in this Github profile, or over at [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/unforswearing).

> I look forward to hearing how I can help you!
