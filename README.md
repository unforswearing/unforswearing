## About

I am a writer, musician, technologist, and self-taught `JavaScript`/`TypeScript`/`Python` programmer currently tinkering with [markup languages](https://github.com/unforswearing/todo_markup.js), [documentation tools](https://github.com/unforswearing/xdoc), [writing systems](https://github.com/unforswearing/poyml), and various [little programs](https://github.com/unforswearing?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=shell) to improve my quality of life at the terminal.

Programming is communication, and I will use any opportunity I can to learn a new language. I have previously dabbled with `Lua`, `Go`, `TCL`, `J`, `F#`, `AWK`, and `Perl`. I'm currently learning more about `Ruby` by building command-line tools and replacing scripts in [my `zsh` shell environment](https://github.com/unforswearing/zsh-config).

My previous professional experience includes blending my programming skills with project management, business workflow automation (primarily using [Google Apps Script](https://github.com/unforswearing?tab=repositories&q=gas)[^*]), content management and administration, data analysis, and crafting copy and documentation for a wide variety of industries.
