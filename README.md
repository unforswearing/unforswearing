## Seeking Employment

I am a writer with over fourteen years of experience creating technical content, designing documentation, writing marketing copy, developing training materials, managing content, and creating business automation. I'm looking forward to diving deeply into the details of my next position. Please get in touch: [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/alvin-charity). 

## Programming

I am a self-taught JavaScript/TypeScript/Python programmer currently making markup and domain-specific languages, writing tools, and various little quality-of-life programs. Additionally I have extensive experience in the shell with Bash and Zsh. My previous professional programming experience includes business workflow automation, web programming, and creating developer tooling. I will use any opportunity I can to learn a new language -- I have previously dabbled with Lua, TCL, J, and F#, and I'm currently learning more about Ruby and Go.
