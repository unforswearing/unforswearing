## Seeking Employment

For the past ten years my work has been at the intersection of technology and content, and I excel at roles that have elements of knowledge management, data analysis, programming / scripting, technical business analysis, technical writing, audio production, and similar. I'm looking forward to diving deeply into the details of my next position. Please get in touch: [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/alvin-charity). 

## Programming

I am a self-taught JavaScript/TypeScript/Python programmer currently making markup and domain-specific languages, writing tools, and various little quality-of-life programs. Additionally I have extensive experience in the shell with Bash and Zsh. My previous professional programming experience includes business workflow automation, web programming, and creating developer tooling. I will use any opportunity I can to learn a new language -- I have previously dabbled with Lua, TCL, J, and F#, and I'm currently learning more about Ruby and Go.
