## Seeking Employment

I am a writer with a broad range of technical experience looking for my next opportunity. 14+ years experience creating technical content, copywriting / user experience writing, managing CMS software, and driving documentation strategy. I have an additional 8 years programming experience (business automation and a bit of frontend development) and four years working as a project manager / PMP. I am open to any role that will allow me to flex my technical and creative skills. Please get in touch: [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/alvin-charity).

I am a self-taught `JavaScript`/`TypeScript`/`Python` programmer currently making [markup](https://github.com/unforswearing/todo_markup.js) [languages](https://github.com/unforswearing/xdoc), [writing tools](https://github.com/unforswearing/poyml), and various little [quality-of-life programs](https://github.com/unforswearing/aliaser). Additionally I have extensive experience in the shell with `Bash` and `Zsh`. My previous professional programming experience includes business workflow automation, web programming, and creating developer tooling. I will use any opportunity I can to learn a new language -- I have previously dabbled with `Lua`, `TCL`, `J`, and `F#`, and I'm currently learning more about `Ruby` and `Go`.

All code is in the public domain unless otherwise specified.
